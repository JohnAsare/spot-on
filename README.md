### How to set up the development environment

Set up a virtualenv with python3

If you don't have Python 3 installed, you will need to do it!

See reference [here](http://www.marinamele.com/2014/07/install-python3-on-mac-os-x-and-use-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper.html) for setting up Python3 and virtualenv.

Type
```
which python3
```
to see the path to your python3 environment

Then execute the following commands to create a new virtualenv
```
mkvirtualenv

```
